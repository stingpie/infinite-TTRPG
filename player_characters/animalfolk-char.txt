Zorgel is a slight dragonfly animalfolk. As a child, they emerged from the wilds in the city of Glermerwood, where they were taken in by a friendly yet childless couple. The couple quickly found that they could easily disguise Zorgel's wings in baggy clothing, and sent them off to school. After several years of a pleasant childhood, their dragonfly wings were eventually discovered by the other children, and Zorgel was bullied endlessly. This caused them to a have a life-long insecurity about their wings, and try to hide them at all costs. Their adoptive parents tried to do everything they could, but eventually Zorgel had enough, and ran away from home to join the circus. Unfortunately, at the time, the circus was out of town, and Zorgel spent their remaining years before adulthood constantly missing the circus as they tried to join it. As a result, Zorgel learned how to be resourceful and charming, and accidentally developed the perfect skillset for an adventurer. Zorgel is very sensitive about being a dragonfly animalfolk, and has developed a boisterous persona as a regular human, but will quickly begin acting insecure and defensive if it's ever suggested that they are not a regular human.
