Glen Blerthers is a crochety old wizard, with a catalog of disaproving stares that would rival the books in the library of alexandria. He will not tolerate tomfoolery, and no one can match his degree of contempt towards quirkiness. He is a SERIOUS wizard, with SERIOUS spells, and he is here to conduct SERIOUS business.  He is known to give a quick whack to the head of anyone wacky, and he has a reputation because of it. Originally, Glen had worked as a wizard's apprentice, but grew disilusioned when his master pulled a rabbit out of a top hat for the 50th time. He carries around various tonics and tinctures, none of which do anything useful.

Glen is a male human standing at 5 feet 10. He wears a blue robe and wizard hat with stars sewn onto them. Despite only being in his mid-twenties, he has a long white beard.
