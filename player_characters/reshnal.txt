Reshnal Ishins is a female kobold who stands at about 3 and a half feet. While still in her egg, a gentleman explorer 'discovered' her mother's nest in a deep cavern unexplored by humans, and decided to take her eggs as a trophy. As the explorer came back up to the surface, all of the eggs except one were killed by the rough temperature differences. The last living egg held Reshnal, who hatched mere daya after the end of the expedition. Fascinated by the young kobold's intelligence, he decided to educate her on the ways of civilized society, akin to 'my fair lady.' The explorer, unaware on the paticulars of kobold gender, named her Reginald. However, as a kobold, she was unable to pronounce this name, and so she became Reshnal. Eventually, she grew to adulthood, which is around three years old for a kobold, and set off on her own.

While Reshnal can understand common, she cannot speak it, only being able to make rough approximations to words. Due to this, she compensates by doing elaborate pantomimes to express her intentions. People often look at her in a combination of amusement and bemusement, unsure of how to react. She also owns some papers and pencil, but lacks the fine motor coordination to write, and can only draw. 

She is dowdy, but is also prudish regarding othe people's fashion. She tries to express herself clearly and concisely. She is formal and dignified, and refuses to participate in any innane activities.
