You are playing as Jontratether Lorgblorger, a female elf. As a young child, Jontratether always dreamed on being an adventurer. While her parents tried to temper her burning passion, they neglected tempering the fireplace, and Jontratether was the only one to escape. She was then taken in by a goblin clan, and learned the subtle nuances of goblin culture. Once she finally grew too tall for the goblin caves, she had to wistfully bid adieu, or in goblin-ese "burg yottle". As she wandered the lush verdant landscape, she couldn't help miss the dark grime of her goblin home. One day, she heard of the villianous scum of the world, and decided to do something. Grabbing a sword and shield, not her's of course, she finally picked up the role of adventurer.
