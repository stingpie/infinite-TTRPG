Backstory:

Thalia was born to an elven mother and a human father in the bustling city of Waterdeep. Her mother, a talented bard, was murdered when Thalia was just a child, leaving her to fend for herself on the streets. She grew up in the shadows, learning the ways of the city and mastering the art of stealth. Her father's identity remains a mystery, fueling her determination to uncover the secrets of her past. Thalia’s life changed when she was taken in by a group of thieves who taught her everything they knew. Now, she seeks to use her skills to protect the helpless and bring justice to those who exploit the weak.

Thalia is slow to trust, but once she does, she is a loyal friend and ally.

She has striking emerald green eyes that seem to pierce through the darkness and shoulder-length raven-black hair often tied back in a loose braid.
