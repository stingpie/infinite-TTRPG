This is the world of Jergenlend! Wonderous wonders and generic fantasy feats occur in ever corner of this detailed world. In the local region, Gerbreg, a shadow has been cast upon the inhabitants. The evil sorcerer, _Malthusius_, has increased cloud cover, which has decreased crop yield by 11.4%! Now it is up to you brave heros to trek across the lands, arrive at the Spire of Malthuse, and put a stop to Mathusius's plans.

Now, you stand in front of a bulletein board calling for adventurers in a small town a few miles from Malthusius's tower, when a couple of other folks congregate around it, too. How about you introduce yourselves to each other?
