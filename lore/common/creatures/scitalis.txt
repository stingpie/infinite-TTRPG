The scitalis is a magical serpent with a stunning pattern on it's scales. It has the ability to conjure illusory monsters from the memories of those around it, but only when it dreams. This is a defense mechanism, as it tends to sleep at the deep end of a cave, and use these illusory monsters to scare off any would-be predators. The scitalis is by no means an intelligent creature, but the illusory creatures it creates are not limited in intelligence, and as such, may try to communicate or deceive on behalf of the scitalis to adventurers who would otherwise hunt it. Due to this, villagers can end up worshiping the cave it resides in, for its ability to 'resurrect' dead loved ones at night, who then proceed to perpetuate the belief that the cave is sacred in order to protect the scitalis inside.

Physically, the scitalis is a very weak and vulnerable creature, possessing no venom and only growing to a maximum length of 2.5 feet. Its bite can only deal a few points of damage, and it cannot constrict like other snakes. As such, it is a very easy foe once understood, but hard to understand in the first place.
