This is a set of pewter soldiers. When shaken, they come to life and begin attacking the closest thing nearby. While this makes them useful for throwing at enemies, they will attack allies if they are too close. In order to make them stop attacking, you either have to cover them in a blanket or some similar fabric, or put them into a container. This seems to calm them down, and returns them to their lifeless state.
