This is a magic ball of yarn, that seems to have a mind of it's own. When left unattended, a strand of yarn will peel off of the ball, and begin exploring, and even mimicking life functions such as sleeping, eating, or drinking. When this yarn is crocheted or knit into the shape of a creature, it gains the abilities of that creature. In this form it will adopt the behavior of the creature, but will always have a dopey and friendly attitude. The magic yarn is vulnerable to fire, but immune to poison.
