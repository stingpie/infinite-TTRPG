Animalfolk are a group of _races_ which are part _human_ and part _animal_. This means that they share characteristics of both humans, such as opposable thumbs or the ability to speak, and animals, such as feathers or claws. There are three distinct categories of animalfolk, depending on how human or animal-like they are. Slight animalfolk only have minor animal features, and can be mistaken for humans at a quick glance. For a slight serpentfolk, this would mean they might have slightly discolored skin, a tendency to elongate the letter 's', and a small tail that can be easily hidden by clothing.

Moderate animalfolk have more pronounced animal characteristics, making them easily distinguishable from humans but still retaining a largely humanoid form. A moderate wolffolk might have fur covering their bodies, a prominent snout, and pointed ears, while still walking on two legs and using their hands as a human would. They blend both human and animal traits more evenly, giving them unique abilities and challenges.

High animalfolk are the most animalistic, possessing the least human features. They are essentially intelligent talking animals, but retain many of their instincts. A high frogfolk would be afraid of heights and anxious when far from a source of water, for example. 

Animalfolk society is diverse and varies greatly depending on the predominant animal traits of its members. Communities are often tight-knit, with a strong emphasis on clan and family ties. Many animalfolk live in harmony with nature, drawing on their animal instincts and abilities to thrive in their environments. They often have unique customs and traditions linked to their animal heritage, which can be seen in their festivals, rituals, and daily life.

The integration of animalfolk into broader human society can vary. Some animalfolk choose to live in secluded communities, while others integrate fully into human cities and towns, using their unique abilities to contribute in various ways. For instance, a moderate birdfolk might excel as a messenger or scout due to their keen eyesight and ability to navigate terrain from above.

Despite their diverse appearances and abilities, animalfolk face challenges such as prejudice and misunderstanding from humans who may fear or distrust their differences. This makes some animalfolk communities secretive and protective, wary of outsiders who might not understand or respect their ways.
