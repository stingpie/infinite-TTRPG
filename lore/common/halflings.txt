Halflings are a cheerful and resilient _race_ known for their hospitality, resourcefulness, and unshakeable optimism. Standing between 3 and 4 feet tall, halflings have a sturdy, compact build, with round faces and warm, inviting smiles. Their skin tones range from ruddy browns to fair hues, and their hair is typically curly or wavy, often in shades of brown or auburn.

Halflings live in close-knit communities that prioritize family, friendship, and simple pleasures. They are skilled farmers, brewers, and craftsmen, creating comfortable and prosperous homes often nestled in rolling hills or along riverbanks. Their villages are famous for their festivals, music, and hearty feasts.

Known for their keen senses and nimbleness, halflings make excellent _rogues_, scouts, and _rangers_. Their natural stealth and agility, combined with their unassuming appearance, allow them to avoid danger and outwit larger foes.
