Sorcerers are innate spellcasters who draw their magic from a powerful, often mysterious source within themselves. Unlike wizards, they do not need to study to cast spells, but instead, their abilities come naturally. Sorcerers are known for their spontaneous and often unpredictable magical prowess.
