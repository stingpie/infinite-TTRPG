Infernals are a unique _race_ marked by their infernal heritage, with traits that reflect their connection to otherworldly powers. Often misunderstood and mistrusted due to their appearance, Infernals are resilient and resourceful, carving their own paths in a world that can be wary of their kind.



Infernals typically have a striking appearance that sets them apart from other races. Common features include:
- **Skin Tones**: Ranging from deep reds and purples to dark blues and even charcoal gray.
- **Eyes**: Often solid colors without visible pupils, glowing with an inner light that can be unsettling to some.
- **Horns**: Various shapes and sizes, from small nubs to large, curling horns.
- **Tails**: Long, prehensile tails that can be used for balance or simple tasks.
- **Other Features**: Some Infernals may have sharp teeth, claw-like nails, or patches of scales.



Infernals possess several innate abilities and traits:
- **Nightvision**: They can see in darkness, their eyes attuned to low-light conditions.
- **Infernal Resistance**: Naturally resistant to fire and other elemental hazards.
- **Charm Resistance**: A strong will that makes them less susceptible to charm and mind-altering effects.
- **Infernal Legacy**: Some Infernals can cast minor spells innately, such as creating small flames or casting illusions.

Infernal culture is as diverse as their appearances. Some live in close-knit communities, bound by a shared heritage and mutual protection, while others integrate into larger societies, often taking on roles that allow them to use their unique abilities to their advantage. Key aspects of Infernal culture include:
- **Independence**: Many Infernals value self-reliance and personal freedom, striving to forge their own destinies.
- **Resourcefulness**: Adaptability and cleverness are prized traits, as Infernals often need to navigate social prejudices.
- **Solidarity**: Despite their independent streak, Infernals often feel a kinship with others of their kind, offering support and guidance when needed.

Infernals often face prejudice and mistrust due to their infernal appearance, but those who take the time to understand them can find loyal and dependable allies. Relationships with other races can vary:
- **Humans**: Mixed reactions, from acceptance and curiosity to fear and suspicion.
- **Elves and Dwarves**: Often cautious, but willing to judge individuals based on their actions rather than their heritage.
- **Halflings and Gnomes**: Generally more accepting, fascinated by the unique traits of Infernals.
